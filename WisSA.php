        <h1>Saving Account</h1>
        <p>A savings account is an interest-bearing deposit account held at a bank or other financial institution. Though these accounts typically pay only a modest interest rate, their safety and reliability make them a good option for parking cash that you want available for short-term needs.</p>
        <p>Savings accounts may have some limitations on how often you can withdraw funds, but generally offer exceptional flexibility that’s ideal for building an emergency fund, saving for a short-term goal like buying a car or going on vacation, or simply sweeping surplus cash you don’t need in your checking account so it can earn a little interest.</p>
        <h3>How Saving Accounts Work?</h3>
        <p>Savings and other deposit accounts are important sources of funds that financial institutions use for loans. For that reason, you can find savings accounts at virtually every bank or credit union, whether they are traditional brick-and-mortar institutions or operate exclusively online. In addition, you can find savings accounts at some investment and brokerage firms.</p>
        <p>Savings account interest rates vary. With the exception of promotions promising a fixed rate until a certain date, banks and credit unions might change their rates at any time. Typically, the more competitive the rate, the more likely it is to fluctuate.</p>
        <p>Changes in the federal funds rate can trigger institutions to adjust their deposit rates. Some institutions offer high-yield savings accounts with significantly higher interest rates for larger minimum deposits, which may be worth investigating.</p>
        <p>Some conventional savings accounts require a minimum balance to avoid monthly fees or earn the highest published rate, while others have no balance requirement. Know the rules of your particular account to ensure you avoid diluting your earnings with fees.</p>
        <p>Money can be transferred in or out of your savings account online, at a branch or ATM, by electronic transfer, or by direct deposit. Transfers can usually be arranged by phone, as well. </p>
        <p>Some banks limit withdrawals to six per month. The Federal Reserve set that limit as a requirement for savings accounts but then withdrew it in April 2020. Exceed six withdrawals with some banks, and the bank may charge a fee, close your account, or convert it to a checking account. The amount that can be withdrawn is limited only to how much is in the account.</p>
        <p>Just as with the interest earned on a money market, certificate of deposit, or checking account, the interest earned on savings accounts is taxable income.</p>
