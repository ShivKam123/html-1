        <h1>Current Account</h1>
        <p>A current account is a bank account where you can store and withdraw money.<br>Most banks offer a range of current accounts that have different features, so you can find an account that best suits your needs.<br>When you open a current account, you are usually assigned an 8-digit account number, a 6-digit sort code and a debit card which you can use to access your funds.</p>
        <p>Recent digitization of finance has led to the rise of digital-only bank accounts that have made banking easier than ever. Businesses can open current accounts from the comfort of their homes, and enjoy a myriad of customized features like integrated vendor payments, payroll, corporate credit cards and more, all from one single account.</p>
        <!-- <p>A current account allows transactions beyond the scope of a savings account.Compared to savings account, a current account requires a higher minimum balance.It is designed to facilitate frequent transactions â€“ transfer funds, receive cheques, cash, etc.A current account can be operated by individuals, proprietary concerns, public and private companies, associations, trusts, etc.No restriction on the number of transactions in a day.Non-maintenance of the minimum balance can attract penalty charges.Just like savings account, KYC guidelines are to be followed even for current accounts.For a single business, there cannot be multiple current accounts.The prime objective of current account is to facilitate smooth transactions for businesses.Nowadays, some banks offer interest rates on current accounts as well.Current accounts charge interests on short-term funds the account holder has borrowed from the bank</p> -->
        <h3>How Current Account Works?</h3>
        <p>Current accounts are used for most everyday banking actions. This includes paying Direct Debits, mobile phone bills, utility bills, making rent payments, making cash deposits and using chip and PIN or contactless to pay for purchases.Most people will get their wages paid into their current account. They then have the option of transferring money to a savings account, or any other bank account if they need to. <br> It depends on what kind of account you have.Basic bank accounts usually don't come with a charge. They are suited to those who have no or low credit rating, as well as young people aged 16 and over. You can still use online and mobile banking free of charge with most basic bank accounts.Standard current accounts, sometimes called 'everyday current accounts', will not charge you for everyday banking if you stay in credit.</p>
